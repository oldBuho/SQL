    "<br>\n",
    "<i>\n",
    "Compressing your time-series data allows you to reduce your chunk size by more than 90%. This saves on storage costs, and keeps your queries operating at lightning speed.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When you enable compression, the data in your hypertable is compressed chunk by chunk. When the chunk is compressed, multiple records are grouped into a single row. The columns of this row hold an array-like structure that stores all the data. This means that instead of using lots of rows to store the data, it stores the same data in a single row. Because a single row takes up less disk space than many rows, it decreases the amount of disk space required, and can also speed up your queries.\n",
    "</i>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To take into consideration: Most indexes set on the hypertable are removed or ignored when reading from compressed chunks. Timescale creates and uses custom indexes to incorporate the segmentby and orderby parameters during compression.\n",
