    "2. There are also people with no listed age (NULL), or who do not appear in the “demos” table, which you will need to keep in mind.\n",

    "In order to understand the demographic of visitors, output a distribution of age by % of total visitors (i.e. for each age, what % of the total population is that age?). Do not include NULLs/missing ages in your calculation and output. \n",

    "\n",
    "Also, add an indicator (0/1) column that indicates whether the visitor had at least one single transaction of over 100 (For example, Mary would be assigned a 1 for this column, as she has at least one transaction over 100.)\n",
